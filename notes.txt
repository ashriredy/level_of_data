Good to have
# Interactive reader  
# Minimalistic code
# Github documentation
# Full-dataset has duplicate rows, deduplicate and give a warning
# if datasets is large, try removing columns that are obviously not part of level
# missing values warning
# drop some columns feature
# if c1 x c2 is a level, c1 x c2 x c3 shouldnt be the level
# selecting columns is being bottleneck
# efficiency - data.table
# efficiency - unique fast
# efficiency - fast accessging a column
